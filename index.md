## Modified Lee More Model (MLM) for Electronic Transport

MLM is a Python library that evaluates the Lee-More (LM) electrical conductivity model. Currently (as of April 2022) the MLM only calculates the electrical conductivity for an unmagnetized plasma. 

The original LM paper is [here](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.864744).

### What is it? 

The MLM is a variant of the original LM model that makes slightly different choices for parameters.  Briefly, choices for undefined parameters (e.g., mean distance between particles) and inconsistent parameters (e.g., using an effective temperature) were made. 

Although the MLM is a standalone library, it was originally developed in the context of discrepancy learning in which the MLM is the base model and conductivity data (originally from Katsouros and DeSilva; [here](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.57.5945)) was used to learn the discrepancy using radial basis function neural networks. That original work is cited below.

### How do I use it? 

The first step is to insall the libray using
```
pip install MLM_Transport
```

Next, import the library into your Python code with
```
import MLM
```

To compute an electrical conductivty with a known element with nuclear charge _Z_, mass density œÅ in g/cc and temperature _T_ in eV, use
```
elect_cond = MLM.ec(z, rho, T).
```
It's that easy! 

Under the hood, MLM uses many other libraries that you might also find useful. See the source code for a full list. For example, MLM uses the Thomas-Fermi ionization model, which can be used by itself as
```
my_zbar = MLM.zbar(z, rho, T)
```


### What's next?

The next version of MLM will include thermal conductivty. Magnetized plasmas for both transport coefficients are next, followed by related transport coefficients. Suggestions and collaborations are welcome.


### Where I can find the data? 

You might also be interested in the experimental data that motivated this project. I have compiled the Katsouros-DeSilva data [here](https://github.com/MurilloGroupMSU/Dense-Plasma-Properties-Database/tree/master/database/DeSilvaKatsouros) and also provide a Jupyter notebook that allows for quick start with the data.
